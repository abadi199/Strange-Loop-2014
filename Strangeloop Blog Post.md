Strange Loop 2014
=================

A couple of developers (Joshua Bradley, Brian Dukes, and I) from Engage went to a conference here in St. Louis called Strange Loop on September 18 and 19, 2014. I have been a big fan of Strange Loop conference, and have attended 4 times before. If you don't know what Strange Loop is, here's a description from their website: 

>Strange Loop is a multi-disciplinary conference that aims to bring together the developers and thinkers building tomorrow's technology in fields such as emerging languages, alternative databases, concurrency, distributed systems, mobile development, and the web.

Strange Loop has always been a place for me to learn about new technology in software development, and also helps me to see what the future is going to look like. And this year was no different. There are tons of new stuff that I learnt from Strange Loop. It is also a really fun conference, and a good intermezzo from our day to day routine working with DNN and DotNet. You can read my notes from Strange Loop on my [github](https://github.com/abadi199/Strange-Loop-2014) page. You can also watch all of the talks on their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_QIfHvN9auy2CoOdSfMWDw)

The conference had 3 keynotes, and some noteable speakers. The first keynote is [The Mess we're in](http://youtu.be/lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong the designer or Erlang programming language. This was a really interesting talk and gave me a new perspective of how difficult programming is.

Another interesting keynote was [Inside the Wolfram Language](http://youtu.be/EjCWdsrVcBM) by Stephen Wolfram, the creator of Mathematica, and Wolfram|Alpha. In this keynote, he introduced his new language called Wolfram Language, a new language that he had been working on for about 35 years. He demoed some of the feature in Wolfram Language. It's a really impressive language.

One noteable speaker from this conference is Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, where he talked about [Transducer](http://youtu.be/6mTbuzafcII). 

The last talk of the conference was [Our Shared Joy of Programming](http://youtu.be/3_zW63dcZB0) by Carin Meier and Sam Aaron, a very inspirational talk which reminded me on why I love programming and why chose to be become a programmer in the first place. Oh, and also, there's this robot dance party!

Here are summaries from some of the few talks that I really like:

## [Democratizing Hardware](http://youtu.be/9xbrMTieJa0)
![Chris Williams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abadi199/Strange-Loop-2014/master/images/IMGP1060.JPG)

This is a talk by Chris Williams ([@voodotikigod](http://www.voodootikigod.com/)). He is the creator of node-serialport which makes develoepr able use JavaScript to control hardware, such as arduino. He is also an advocate for teaching hardware programming to kids.
On his talks, he mentioned about the importance of making hardware programming available to general public, including the danger if only some group of people have control of the future technology, for example this [programmable matters technology](http://youtu.be/5W7fH1sv26o). Another important point from his talk is the importance of community and open source in making hardware programming more accessible to general public. Open source Maker community such as [Makerspace](http://makerspace.com/) or [Makerfaire](http://makerfaire.com/) is a great place where you can share hardware design, or print your robot design for free.

## [Web Apps without Web Servers](http://youtu.be/WqV5kqaFRDU)
This is a talk by Richard Feldman ([@rtfeldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman)). On this talk, he demonstrated a web app called [Dreamwriter](https://dreamwriter.io/) that can run completely offline, and built completely using web standards (Application cache, FileReader API, IndexedDB)

## [React: RESTful UI Rendering](http://youtu.be/IVvHPPcl2TM)
This talk was presented by Pete Hunt ([@floydophone](https://twitter.com/floydophone)), he is a developer from Instagram, and a contributor to [reactjs](http://reactjs.org). React is a relatively new web framework developed by Instagram and is being used by Instagram and Facebook. It's using a virtual DOM diff implementation, which can also be rendered on the server using node.js. You can also use an optional syntax  called JSX (which is an XML-like syntax) to build and render your DOM. It's an interesting framework for sure, and I'm planning keep my eye on this framework and see how well the adaptation of this framework compare to other frameworks such as [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) or [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/).

## [Spreadsheets for Developer](http://youtu.be/0CKru5d4GPk)
![Felienne Hermans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abadi199/Strange-Loop-2014/master/images/IMGP1081.JPG)

This is a very interesting and fun talks by ([Felienne Hermans](http://www.www.felienne.com)). In her talks, she explained that Spreadsheets (in this case Microsoft Excel) is actually a programming language and passed the touring test. She demoed writing a selection sort algorithm just using Excel, which is very impressive. She didn't use macro or VBA, only pure Excel functions and formulas. One of my favorite quote from the talk is

>By thinking spreadsheet as programming language, we help spreadsheets user to think as programmer.

I highly recommend for you to watch this talk.

## [PureScript or, what if brendan had been SPJ](http://youtu.be/yIlDBPiMb0o)
This talk was presented by Bodil Stokke ([@bodil](https://twitter.com/bodil)), it was about Purescript, a haskell like language that compiles into JavaScript. If you really love Haskell syntax and wish JavaScript could be more like Haskell, than you should definitely give Purescript a try.

That's all I have on Strange Loop 2014. It's still my favorite conference, and I would recommend you to register for this conference next year. I'll see you at Strange Loop in 2015!
